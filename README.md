# General ML Framework

General ML Framework is a repository that provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for training machine learning models for image classification, image segmentation, and object detection tasks. The repository is designed to be easily modifiable and extensible, allowing users to incorporate new datasets, models, losses, and more.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Train models to classify images into multiple classes.
- **Image Segmentation**: Train models to perform pixel-level segmentation of images.
- **Object Detection**: Train models to detect and localize objects within images.
- **Easy Customization**: Easily incorporate new datasets, models, losses, and other components.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configure training parameters, hyperparameters, and experiment settings.
- **Preprocessing and Augmentation**: Apply various preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies.
- **Evaluation and Metrics**: Evaluate model performance using standard metrics for each task.
- **Visualization**: Visualize model predictions, ground truth annotations, and other analysis outputs.
- **Checkpointing and Logging**: Save checkpoints of trained models and log training progress.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-image-toolkit.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up the project environment:

Optional: Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)

OR
.\env\Scripts\activate # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)


## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:

- For image classification: Organize your dataset into separate folders for each class.
- For image segmentation: Prepare images and corresponding masks for each sample.
- For object detection: Create annotation files or use popular formats like Pascal VOC or COCO.

2. Configure the training settings:

- Modify the configuration files in the `configs` directory to specify dataset paths, model architectures, training parameters, etc.

3. Start the training:

- Run the training script for your desired task:

  ```
  python train_classification.py
  python train_segmentation.py
  python train_detection.py
  ```

4. Monitor the training:

- View training logs, loss curves, and other visualizations in real-time using TensorBoard:

  ```
  tensorboard --logdir=logs/
  ```

5. Evaluate the trained models:

- Use the evaluation scripts to assess the performance of trained models on test/validation data:

  ```
  python evaluate_classification.py
  python evaluate_segmentation.py
  python evaluate_detection.py
  ```

6. Make predictions:

- Use the provided inference scripts to make predictions on new images:

  ```
  python infer_classification.py
  python infer_segmentation.py
  python infer_detection.py
  ```

7. Customize and extend:

- Explore the repository structure and modify the code to suit your specific needs.
- Add new datasets, models, losses, or other components using the provided templates and guidelines.
